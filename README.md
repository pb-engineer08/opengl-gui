#  Previous research and development 
  ▪ Performed my master's thesis with a focus on virtualization in automotive systems(ECUs) following
    ISO 26262 functional safety requirements.
    
  ▪ As an experienced Linux professional, my role also includes managing virtual environments using an
    embedded hypervisor, for instance, Xen.
    
  ▪ Providing effective solutions for resource partitioning in high computing SoC such as ARM v7
    microprocessor.
    
   ▪  I/O driver design and Implementation  
   
   ▪ Logging wrapper for robotic arm automation and navigation messages
   
   ▪ Research on the selection and comparison of open-source C/C++ mathematical libraries
  
   ▪ Research in OpenMP parallel and thread computing library, Intel C++ compiler to gain more experience in analyzing how fast embedded devices can digitize signal data
  
   ▪ Research in Automatic visual inspection and tests of waveforms chart display using AI methods
  
   ▪ Active safety application using lidar sensor
  
  ▪ Image classification based on Convolutional Neural Networks
